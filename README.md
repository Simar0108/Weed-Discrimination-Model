# Weed-Discrimination-Model
Weed Discrimination Deep Learning Model using YOLOv8

Employed Roboflow as a strategic tool to streamline the meticulous process of generating annotated datasets, enabling accurate differentiation between crop fields and invasive weeds.

Effectively transitioned curated datasets to YOLOv8's convolutional neural networks, harnessing the capabilities of its deep-learning PyTorch framework. 

Operated code within Google Colab, yielding outstanding results: 99% precision for pepper, 78% for weeds, and an 89.5% mAP score.
